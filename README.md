# Sorting Hat

This repository is one example of how a person can build their own moving, talking Sorting Hat. There are a few different Sorting Hats out there with different levels of complexity. I would like to propose my own, which is easy for beginners and relatively inexpensive.

This project specifically is a Sorting Hat that uses a touch sensor for activation, servo motors for movement, and a mirco SD card/speaker for audio. It was built for a computer science class as a summer semester project.
