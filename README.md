# Sorting Hat [v1.0]

This repository is one example of how a person can build their a personal moving, talking Sorting Hat. There are a few different Sorting Hats out there with different levels of complexity. This is simply a proposal of another way which is easy for beginners and relatively inexpensive.

This project specifically is a Sorting Hat that uses a touch sensor for activation, servo motors for movement, and a mirco SD card/speaker for audio. It was built for a computer science class as a summer semester project and based off of a project from the Arduino Project Hub by user jegatheesan. The link to the original project can be found here:

Here is what the final project looks like:

# Repository Contents

The following is a list of the contents of this repository:

* /build - This is where to find all the final software for the Sorting Hat (.ino).
* /img - This is where to find all the images contained in this README (.jpg).
* /examples - These are some example program files that can be run to test hardware (.ino).
* /README.md

# Requirements and Materials

The following is a list of required libraries and hardware:

Libraries:
-

* SD Library (included with Arduino IDE)
* ServoTimer2 Library https://github.com/nabontra/ServoTimer2
* TMRpcm Library https://github.com/TMRh20/TMRpcm

Hardware:
-

* 1 x Arduino Uno 
* 1 x breadboard
* 5 x servo motors
* 1 x touch sensor (AT42QT1070)
* 1 x mirco SD card
* 1 x mirco SD card reader
* 1 x speaker
* 1 x 560 ohm resistor
* 1 x transistor
* Wires to connect everything

Audio:
-

Audio files will also be necessary for the Sorting Hat and they can be found here:
https://github.com/Bachmann1234/sortinghat/tree/master/audio
Note: The names of the files will need to be changed to something shorted (ie. A1.wav). If the file name is too long, it will not play.

# Build Instructions

In this section, it is important to not only discuss the hardware used, but also the aesthetic choices made while constructing the Sorting Hat because for a project like this, appearance is paramount.

Step 1: You will need to construct the basic shape of the hat. This can be done using poster board and foam board.
(a) Create the cone out of the poster board.
(b) Draw the appearance of the Sorting Hat on it.
(c) Cut the cone into three separate pieces at the mouth, the eyes, and at the top.
(d) Using the foam board, create surfaces to place at the bottom and top of all three pieces (with the exception of the bottom of the hat).
(e) Once these surfaces have been added to the hat, use some sort of fabric to glue the back of all three pieces together, creating a single piece.

This is what your hat should look like by the end of this step:

Step 2: Now it is time to add the servo motors.

# Usage

Here are the instructions on how to use the device once it has been completed:

- Plug the Arduino into the computer.
- Upload the code sorting_hat_2017.ino to the Arduino.
- Place the Sorting Hat on someone's head to activate the touch sensor.
- The hat will then begin to speak and move until the person has been "sorted" into a house.
- Once the person has been sorted, there will be five seconds to remove the hat before the program loops again.
- And that's all there is to it! Unplug the hat from the computer when finished.
